Syslinux Boot Menu Editor v0.1
by Chris van Marle (qistoph)

Available under GPLv3 (see LICENSE) from https://github.com/qistoph/SyslinuxEditor

USAGE:
An online version is not yet available, but I'm planning on hosting
the Syslinux Boot Menu Editor online in the near future.

The editor is developped for and tested with the currently latest version of Chrome.

Write and edit a syslinux configuration file in the textbox on the right. Graphical
menu settings will be reflected in the preview on the left. Have a look at the
included samples, samples online or the Syslinux documentation for possibilities.

To preview helptexts and highlighting, focus the preview by clicking on it, and
use the arrow keys (up and down) to navigate through the menu.

Chrome doesn't allow loading local files dynamically. Because of this the
samples don't load properly. To view the samples you could copy paste the
contents of a sample in the textbox.
Loading menu backgrounds locally isn't a problem though. Some examples that work
in Chrome on Windows:
- menu background file:///C:/syslinuxeditor/backgrounds/splash.png
- menu background C:/syslinuxeditor/backgrounds/splash.jpg
- menu background backgrounds/splash.png
- menu background http://www.somesite.com/images/background640x480.jpg
Ofcourse you'll have to make sure the path is correct(ed) when using the
background in an actual syslinux configuration file. Online backgrounds for
example, won't be available at boot :)

TODO:
This is a list of features/improvements I've come up with. If you'd like to
participate, you're very welcome to work on any of these.
- git-version.js placeholder for offline versions
- Fix transparency overlay (syslinux doesn't stack, CSS does)
- Support F1, F2 etc pages
- Support sub menu's?
- Complete configuration parsing/handling parameters that apply
- Add color picker for easier color selection (http://www.eyecon.ro/colorpicker/?)
- Improve some of the design of the page
- Host online version
